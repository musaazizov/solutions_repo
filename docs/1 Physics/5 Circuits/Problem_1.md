\section*{üß† Motivation}
Calculating equivalent resistance is a foundational problem in physics and electrical engineering. While simple series and parallel resistor combinations are easy to analyze by hand, more complex circuits can quickly become unmanageable.

By applying graph theory, we can treat an electrical circuit as a mathematical graph:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nodes (vertices) represent junctions where wires or components meet.
    \item Edges represent resistors, and each edge is labeled with a weight equal to the resistor‚Äôs resistance value.
\end{itemize}

Graph theory allows for a systematic, repeatable process for reducing complex resistor networks to a single equivalent resistance between two points (terminals). This is especially useful in automation, simulation tools, and optimization tasks in circuit design.

\section*{üî¢ Key Concepts}

\subsection*{1. Series Connection}
Two resistors are in series if:
\begin{itemize}
    \item They are connected end-to-end.
    \item No branching exists between them.
    \item The same current flows through both.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rule:}
\[
R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 + \dots + R_n
\]

\subsection*{2. Parallel Connection}
Two or more resistors are in parallel if:
\begin{itemize}
    \item They are connected between the same two nodes.
    \item The voltage across each is the same.
    \item The current divides among the resistors.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rule:}
\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{R_n}
\]

\section*{üìâ Graph Theory Approach}

\subsection*{A. Representing the Circuit as a Graph}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vertices:} Electrical junctions or nodes
    \item \textbf{Edges:} Resistors (with weights equal to resistance values)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{B. Algorithm Steps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input:} A graph representing a resistor network, and two terminals (start and end nodes)
    \item Identify Series Connections:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Look for a node connected to exactly two other nodes (and is not a terminal).
            \item Collapse this node and add the two resistances.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Identify Parallel Connections:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Check for multiple edges (resistors) between the same two nodes.
            \item Combine them using the parallel rule.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reduce the Graph:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Continue identifying and simplifying series and parallel structures.
            \item Iteratively simplify until only one edge remains between the start and end nodes.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Output:} The weight of the final edge is the equivalent resistance between the terminals.
\end{itemize}

\section*{üîç Examples of Application}

\subsection*{üîπ Example 1: Simple Series}

\textbf{Circuit:}
\[
\text{A} \xrightarrow{5\,\Omega} \text{B} \xrightarrow{10\,\Omega} \text{C}
\]

Start Node (S): A \\
End Node (T): C

Node B has 2 connections $\Rightarrow$ series.

\[
R_{\text{eq}} = 5 + 10 = 15\,\Omega
\]

\subsection*{üîπ Example 2: Simple Parallel}

\textbf{Circuit:}

Two resistors between A and B:

\[
\text{A} \xrightarrow{10\,\Omega} \text{B}, \quad \text{A} \xrightarrow{20\,\Omega} \text{B}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{20} = \frac{3}{20} \Rightarrow R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67\,\Omega
\]

\subsection*{üîπ Example 3: Mixed/Nested Circuit}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A connects to B with $4\,\Omega$
    \item B connects to D with $6\,\Omega$
    \item A connects to C with $12\,\Omega$
    \item C connects to E with $12\,\Omega$
    \item D and E connect to each other with $6\,\Omega$
\end{itemize}

Goal: Find equivalent resistance between A and E.

\textbf{Steps:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Series: $R_{BD} = 4 + 6 = 10\,\Omega$
    \item Series: $R_{CE} = 12 + 12 = 24\,\Omega$
    \item D‚ÄìE link: $6\,\Omega$ connects two paths
    \item Path 1: A‚ÄìB‚ÄìD‚ÄìE = $10 + 6 = 16\,\Omega$
    \item Path 2: A‚ÄìC‚ÄìE = $24\,\Omega$
\end{itemize}

\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{24} = \frac{5}{48} \Rightarrow R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{48}{5} = 9.6\,\Omega
\]

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scalable:} Works for any complexity.
    \item \textbf{Systematic:} Reduces manual trial and error.

\section*{‚è±Ô∏è Efficiency Considerations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For small circuits, the approach is fast and intuitive.
